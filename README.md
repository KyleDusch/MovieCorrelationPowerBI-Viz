# MovieCorrelationPowerBI-Viz

Power BI visualization of the Top 100 movies (by net gross ) from movie correlation csv file

Used the same csv file from the Movie Correlation Project and wanted to visualize Data in regards to genre, profit and director. Any additions to the other project I wanted to visualize and create presentable data in an easy to understand way.
